# atricapilla_iris
Data analysis of the eye colour of Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla)


This project seeks to identify a relationship between the iris colour (analysed in terms of three parameters: chroma, hue and brightness) and sex or age of Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla). 

Data is displayed on a 3D scatter plot and in histograms for each of the three parameters. 

Finally, a Gaussian fit is performed and plotted for each histogram.
